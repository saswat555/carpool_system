# carpool_system
This is a carpool system which I made for a 24-hour hackathon. Since it was a 24 hr hackathon, the build is not very sturdy but still, its good enough to give you idea of bulding full-stack webapp using Python Flask.
For this project I used Flask as a web-framework. I used Html,Css and Javascript for the frontend part. The main idea behind this was to make a system that can provide a carpool facility to anyone who is in the path of the vehicle owner. The vehicle owner can select his path before starting the journey.
## Features
-> Login and Signup for vehicle owner
-> Vehicle owner details for extra security
-> GPS based time and distance calculation using googlemaps
-> Fare calculation based on vehicle owner mentioned price
-> Dynamic menu to select the location
-> Request generation for travelling in the carpool which can be reverted by the owner

I am also planning to add more features in this web-app and would be open for open source contributions.
